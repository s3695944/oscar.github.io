											after I coming to Australia
											Because I don't have a piano

											The piano keys are really small !!!!

											<br>This is a front-end design career using html css javascript WordPress</p>
								</header>
								
								<p class="content">Why is this position attracting me?
										<br>This is a front-end design career using html
										I can build a webpage
										And design some web page layouts
										Because the company has a long history
										So my work can be stable
										Cooperation with colleagues can be harmonious
										 
										
										
										<br>Requirements for this position
										<br>I need to know the code knowledge of html css javascript and wordpress
										And can be used in conjunction with php and SQL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
										 
										<br>The skills I have
										<br>I learned a little bit of html and css on GitHub. I have to continue learning.
										And I am missing javascrip and wordpress knowledge
										And php.SQL knowledge
										 
										<br>A plan
										 
										<br>Because html css javascript is the basis of a web page
										So I can learn these three skills together.
										And learn to connect with php and SQL
										In addition, I have to learn to build a website with wordpress alone.</p>

									<p><br>My Myers-Briggs test result is INTJ
										<br>Introverted: slight
										<br>Intuition: slight
										<br>Thinking: slight
										<br>	Judgment: medium
										<br>	The result of my online learning style test is
										<br>	Auditory: 35%
										<br>	Visual: 35%
										<br>	Tactile: 30%
										<br>	My psychometric test
											{You love interacting with people and do so with empathy, patience and understanding. You value respect , 
												loyalty and patience and enjoy engaging with people on an authentic
												 and human level as you understand the positive impact you can have on people.
												  You connect with people easily ad itâ€™s as rewarding for you as it is for them.}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
											 
											<br>These tests show that I am good at analyzing and judging. You can grasp the work items from the whole. Strong thinking ability. But I may give me a bad plan to waste my time.
											My learning ability is relatively average. I can learn knowledge in a variety of ways. But it may not be possible to learn from one aspect. Learning from one aspect will make me bored.
											Tested in my heart. Let me work in harmony with my colleagues. And learn the advantages of others. So form a team. I can analyze work items in the team.  But I may give a lot of work to my teammates. Give teammates a lot of pressure. So I am not suitable as a group leader.
											I can help my teammates learn new things in the group.</p>
